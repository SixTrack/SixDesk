This document replaces the ``Run Environment for SixTrack''~\cite{Runsix}, and
describes how massive tracking campaigns can be performed with
``SixTrack''~\cite{SixTrack} starting from a MAD-X input file of the LHC
or HL-LHC\footnote{The HiLumi LHC Design Study is included in the High
  Luminosity LHC project and is partly funded by the European Commission
  within the Framework Programme 7 Capacities Specific Programme, Grant
Agreement 284404.} lattices, the so called mask files. It describes a new set
of UNIX BASH or Korn shell scripts which allow the use of the Berkeley Open
Infrastructure for Network Computing, BOINC~\cite{Boinc}) as an alternative to
the Linux LSF batch system. This note is also published and regularly updated
on the web page

\section{Objectives}
%
The principal objective of the SixDesk run environment is to allow a physicist
to run a tracking campaign, on either the CERN LSF batch system or BOINC, using
the familiar SixTrack run environment on Linux.  At the same time, the
opportunity was taken to group all user modifiable parameters into two files,
\texttt{sixdeskenv} and \texttt{sysenv}, and to speed up \texttt{run\_mad6t}, the MAD-X
to SixTrack conversion, by running in parallel in batch.  The specification of
tune scans, fractional amplitude ranges and steps, and various other physics
options were also added to the \texttt{run\_six} script/command.  All SixDesk
scripts report activity to the \texttt{sixdesk.log} file and exit with an error
code if an unrecoverable error is detected.  The messages are optionally sent
to \texttt{STDOUT}, your screen, in an interactive session.
%
\section{Getting Started} First note that in order to use BOINC you must not
only have a CERN account but must also be registered in the AFS protection
group boinc:users. This is done with the script \texttt{add\_boinc\_user} but only
E. McIntosh, M. Giovannozzi and IT BOINC administrators are authorised to do
so.

All the user modifiable parameters have been collected into the two scripts
\texttt{sixdeskenv}, \texttt{sysenv} obviating the need to look through all scripts
and make matching changes, simplifying the usage of the scripts, and limiting
the risk of error.

It is assumed that there is a large amount (at least 1GB) of disk space
available to be used as a workspace which we shall call \texttt{w1} for
illustration. The \texttt{w1} directory can be a link in \texttt{\$HOME} to a
directory with the same name, usually on an scratch disk (AFS scratch0,
scratch1, etc or in a /scratch directory).  Note that by default access to all
AFS files will be limited; it is useful to do a {\tt fs setacl w1
system:anyuser rl} so that everything in an AFS workspace can be read by the
support team. In the following it is also assumed that the \texttt{.} directory is
in the \texttt{\$PATH} environment variable.

A workspace can created by e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
 cd $HOME
 mkdir -p scratch0/w1
 ln -s ~/scratch0/w1 w1 
 cd w1
 fs setacl . system:anyuser rl
\end{verbatim}
and the SixDesk environment is created by
\begin{verbatim}
 cd $HOME/w1
 svn checkout  http://svn.cern.ch/guest/sixdesk/sixjobs
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
 cd $HOME/w1
 gtar xvzf /afs/cern.ch/project/sixtrack/src/ \
           SixDesk_run_environment.pro.tgz
\end{verbatim}
where the first method will get the latest SVN committed version and the second
method uses a link to a tar file which will be updated in parallel with the SVN
commits.

This will create a directory subtree starting with the directory \texttt{sixjobs}.
An overview of this directory is shown in Appendix \ref{sec:commands}.  The
latest source and postscript of this document can be found in the directory
\texttt{sixjobs/doc}.  All the scripts are stored in \texttt{sixjobs} itself and the
user should always do a \texttt{cd w1/sixjobs} before executing any commands. It
may be necessary to prefix any typed commands with a \texttt{./} if your shell
PATH does not include the current directory \texttt{"."}.  The source version of
each script can be found in \texttt{sixjobs/scripts} as will be discussed later.

At this point it is important to check that the LOCALE environment variable
LANG has the value C or other English-like setting, since it has been noted
that the \texttt{awk} program gives errors if this is not the case. This is
normally set, but it it is not the default on some laptops and on MacOS.

\section{Setting up a Study}
\label{sec:study}

To facilitate the description of the various procedures we use the directory
\texttt{w1} as workspace and a study named \texttt{job\_tracking} as an illustration.
Both names can and should be adapted to the user needs.

A study is controlled by the \texttt{sixdeskenv} file that contains all the MAD-X
information controlling the simulations: location of the  input file
(called \texttt{.mask} files), the location of the temporary files, the definition
of the beam distributions, the number of turns to be tracked or stored and the
type of post processing. The corresponding mask file \texttt{job\_tracking.mask}
is included in the release in the \texttt{sixjobs/mask} directory. Note that the
name of the study is contained in the variable \texttt{LHCDescrip} i.e. if we have
a study called \texttt{lhc\_nob1} then we must define it with {\tt export
LHCDescrip=lhc\_nob1}. It should also be noted that amplitudes and amplitude
ranges are specified in beam $\sigma$.

There are several supported types of study, short studies using SixTrack and
possibly Sussix, long tracking studies using SixTrack, and DA map production
using the SixTrack DA version.  Performing a tracking study involves running
many jobs for an LHC configuration with many different initial phase space
amplitudes and angles and linear tunes. The LHC configuration is defined by a
mask file in the \texttt{sixjobs/mask} sub-directory and the initial conditions
in the \texttt{sixdeskenv, sysenv} files.

The first step is to edit the \texttt{sixdeskenv} script and, if necessary, the
\texttt{sysenv} script.

NOTA BENE:It is essential to issue a \texttt{set\_env} command after any
modification to these files so that they are saved in the \texttt{studies/study}
directory as described later.  Note also, that as shown below all values must
be exported.

The main parameter to be set in the \texttt{sixdeskenv} file are:
\begin{description}
\item [export LHCDescrip=job\_tracking] the name of the study and of the mask file
\item [export basedir=/afs/cern.ch/user/\$initial/\$LOGNAME]
\item [export scratchdir=/afs/cern.ch/user/\$initial/\$LOGNAME/scratch0]
\item [export trackdir=\$scratchdir/\$workspace]
can be re-defined to use an area shared between studies or workspaces;
\item [export sixtrack\_input=\$scratchdir/sixtrack\_input/\$workspace/\$LHCDescrip]
can be changed to point to, and use, an existing set of \texttt{sixtrack\_input} files.
\end{description}

The above defaults, apart from the name of the study, are usually satisfactory
but, once chosen, cannot be changed easily. Other parameters of the run can be
decided later.

At this point:
\begin{verbatim}
 cd ~/w1/sixjobs
 set_env
\end{verbatim}
will create the full directory structure of the environment.  As already
mentioned this command should also be used to save modified versions of the
\texttt{sixdeskenv, sysenv} files before doing anything else. The command also
reports and logs changes.

While it is recommended to run one study per workspace at the time, most users
have multiple studies in the workspace. The command \texttt{ls studies} can be
used to list them and \texttt{set\_env "name of the study"} to switch between
studies.  This switch copies the \texttt{sixdeskenv, sysenv} files from the {\tt
studies} directory to \texttt{sixdeskhome} i.e. the current \texttt{sixjobs}
directory.

An important new feature is that it is possible to execute many commands on a
specific study without switching. This facilitates running multiple studies in
the same workspace and using commands in batch jobs.  Thus, instead of
switching, a command can be suffixed with a "study" and optionally a
"platform". Examples are shown later.  This option is NOT available for the
backup or recall, study or workspace, commands described in section
\ref{sec:backup}where a \texttt{set\_env "study"} must first be performed.

The \texttt{print\_env} command reports the complete environment to the screen;
the command \texttt{mywhich} reports a few important values.

Finally note that it is vital that the same versions of SixTrack and MAD-X are
used for all cases in a study. Ideally the MAD-X \texttt{run\_mad6t} jobs should
be run on the same type of computer to avoid small numeric differences.
Compatible versions of these programs for LSF and BOINC are specified
in \texttt{sysenv}, the so-called "pro" versions. Any changes will be notified.

In view of some problems uncovered with MAD-X result differences the run_mad6t
and {\tt check\_mad6t} scripts have been modified to make further checks on
the results. See section \ref{sec:mad_6t} for details.

\section{Overview of the Data Structure}

The \texttt{set\_env} will have created the \texttt{sixtrack\_input}, {\tt
studies/study},\texttt{track} and \texttt{work} directories, as well as various
log-file links and directories.  The files \texttt{sixtrack\_input}, \texttt{study},
\texttt{track}, \texttt{work} are in fact links to the actual directories. An empty
file with the name of the study is also created to facilitate SHELL command
completion.

The \texttt{sixtrack\_input} directory will later (after a successful mad6t run)
hold all the SixTrack input mother files \texttt{fort.3.mother1} and {\tt
fort.3.mother2} derived from the mother files in the \texttt{control\_files}
directory as well as a \texttt{fort.3.mad} and a \texttt{fort.3.aux} and one {\tt
fort.2\_"seedno".gz}, \texttt{fort.8\_"seedno".gz}, \texttt{fort.16\_"seedno".gz} for
each seed in the range \texttt{istamad} to \texttt{iendmad} as defined in {\tt
sixdeskenv}. In addition it will hold one \texttt{mad.dorun\_mad6t*} directory for
each \texttt{run\_mad6t} command, with one mad6t LSF job {\tt
mad6t\_"seedno".lsf}, one input file \texttt{"study"."seedno"}, one LSF job log
\texttt{"study"\_mad6t\_"seedno".log} and one mad6t output file {\tt
"study".out."seedno"} for each seed.

The \texttt{studies} directory will hold one directory for each study, in turn
containing the \texttt{sixdeskenv, sysenv} files for that study.

The \texttt{track} directory will become a hierarchy containing all the SixTrack
data and results as follows:
\begin{description}
\item [Level 1 Seed] typically 1 to 60
\item [        general\_input] containing normalised emittance and gamma
\item [Level 2 simul] for long tracking and/or 
\item [        trans momen] for short/sussix runs
\item [Level 3 tunex\_tuney] e.g. 64.31\_59.32
\item [Level 4 amplitude range] e.g. 18\_20 and 18-22 after post-processing
\item [Level 5 turns exponent] e.g. \texttt{e5} for $10^5$ turns
\item [Level 6 the phase space angle] e.g. 67.5  
\item [Level 7] input(links), \texttt{fort.2,3,8,16.gz } and the result {\tt
  fort.10.gz} as well as the LSF jobs and logs
\end{description}
A partial view of the \texttt{track} tree is shown in Appendix \ref{sec:plot}.  A
typical lowest level structure (after the study has been completed),
for workspace w1, study job\_tracking, long run (simul), seed 1, tunes
64.28\_59.31, amplitude range 10\_12, $10^5$ turns, phase space angle 1.5, is:
\begin{verbatim}
 ~/w1/sixjobs/track/1/simul/64.28_59.31/10_12/e5/1.5
 fort.10.gz
 fort.16.gz -> 
 ~mcintosh/scratch0/sixtrack_input/w1/job_tracking/fort.16_1.gz
 fort.2.gz -> 
 ~mcintosh/scratch0/sixtrack_input/w1/job_tracking/fort.2_1.gz
 fort.3.gz
 fort.8.gz -> 
 ~mcintosh/scratch0/sixtrack_input/w1/job_tracking/fort.8_1.gz
 job_tracking%1%s%64.28_59.31%10_12%5%1.5.log
 job_tracking%1%s%64.28_59.31%10_12%5%1.5.lsf
\end{verbatim}
Note that input files are in fact links to sixtrack\_input, in order to save
disk space, apart from the fort.3.gz which is of course different for each job.
The result file is fort.10.gz described in section \ref{sec:fort10}. The .lsf
and .log files are the LSF job file and the LSF job log file for the particular
case.

It should be noted that there is a one to one mapping between the name of a
case and the directory where the input and output files are stored. The general
form of the name of a case in a \texttt{long} run is
\begin{verbatim}
study%seed%s%tune_range%amplitude_range%turns_exponent%angle
\end{verbatim}
In the workspace this case would be found in the directory
\begin{verbatim}
track/'seed'/simul/'tune_range'/'amplitude_range'/  \
e'turns_exponent'/'angle'
\end{verbatim}
To give a specific example, a case named
\begin{verbatim}
job_tracking%1%s%62.31_60.32%10_12%5%18
\end{verbatim} would be found in the \texttt{w1/sixjobs/track} directory for 
this study in the sub-directory
\begin{verbatim}
sixjobs/track/1/simul/62.31_60.32/10_12/e5/18
\end{verbatim}
this particular case being for seed number 1, tunex and tuney 62.31 and 60.32,
amplitude range 10 to 12, $10^5$ turns, angle 18. (The directory simul could
also be instead \texttt{trans} or \texttt{momen} for short/sussix runs and the
letter 's' in the name being replaced by 't' or 'm'.)

This case name is used in the database, to name the LSF jobs and logs, and is
also included in the SixTrack \texttt{fort.6} output. Note that as warned in a
comment in the \texttt{sixdeskenv} file this name must NOT have a \% character nor
two consecutive underscores.

The \texttt{work} directory will contain the database flat files for reporting and
managing all the tasks and jobs of a particular study.  The most interesting
files are \texttt{work/taskids}, \texttt{work/completed\_cases}, {\tt
work/incomplete\_cases} and the sub-directory {\tt work/lsfjobs (or
boincjobs)}.  The master file is called \texttt{taskids} and contains one line for
every case of a study with the case name followed by one or more LSF or BOINC
taskids. The \texttt{run\_status} command reports on the status of the study as
described in section \ref{sec:status}.

There are also the other directories:
\begin{description}
\item [bin] containing links to various utility programs used by \texttt{run\_six}
(\texttt{dalie4 dalie6 readda}), \texttt{run\_join10} (\texttt{joinf10})
and \texttt{run\_post} (\texttt{read10b}) \item [control\_files] the SixTrack mother
  files for the collision/injection/beam 2 cases which are used to generate the
  SixTrack input files
\item [doc] The Latex source and Postscript of this document
\item [inc] other mask files and the prepare\_fort.3 script
\item [mask] the LHC description mask files for MAD-X
\item [plot] the plotting mask files and scripts in the sub-directory {\tt
  plot/inc}.  The sub-directory \texttt{plot/"study"} will contain a hierarchy
  matching the \texttt{track} hierarchy, but with the \texttt{angle} directory
  replaced by a hidden directory \texttt{.angle}  containing some or all of the
  files {\tt averem.eps.gz distance.eps.gz fort.10.gz fort.15.gz fort.30.gz
    maxslope.eps.gz smear.eps.gz survival.eps.gz test.ps.gz}.
\item [sixdeskTaskIds] the study TaskIds for BOINC
\item [scripts] the source and copies of the commands
\item [utilities] the various LSF job masks for \texttt{run\_mad6t} and \texttt{run\_six}
\end{description}
\section{Running mad6t to produce the basic SixTrack input files}
\label{sec:mad_6t}
NOTA BENE: It is essential to have a \$LHCDescrip.mask file in the subdirectory
\texttt{mask} in order to run MAD-X to produce the SixTrack input files. This mask
file in turn references many LHC Database files and this often requires some
checking.  Sample mask files can be found in the directory mask:
\begin{verbatim}
 jobref503_withbb_coll.mask  jobrefslhc_withbb_coll.mask  
 jobref503_withbb_inj.mask   jobref503_inj.mask        
 jobrefslhc_inj.mask         jobrefslhc_withbb_inj.mask
 jobref503_coll.mask         jobrefslhc_coll.mask        
 job_tracking.mask
\end{verbatim}
The file job\_tracking.mask is copied from
/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/SLHCV3.01 and all the others from
/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/SLHCV2.0 \cite{31b}.

In order to investigate a series of random seeds the particular seed number in
the MAD input file has to be replaced by a variable name:
\begin{verbatim}
Set, SEEDSYS , 1 ;
Set, SEEDRAN , 1 ;
\end{verbatim}
becomes
\begin{verbatim}
Set, SEEDSYS , %SEEDSYS ;
Set, SEEDRAN , %SEEDRAN ;
\end{verbatim}
The place keepers \texttt{\%SEEDSYS} and \texttt{\%SEEDRAN} will be replaced
automatically by a proper seed number by \texttt{run\_mad6t} based on the current
seed number based on the \texttt{istamad and iendmad} variables defined in {\tt
sixdeskenv}.

In addition, in order to use the correct bunch size, the place keeper {\tt
\%NPART} is replaced by the value specified for the \texttt{bunch\_charge}
variable also in \texttt{sixdeskenv}.

Please note that the MAD-X \texttt{sixtrack} command takes its information from
the last \texttt{Twiss, save} command. It is a sensible precaution to put these
commands consecutively in the MAD script and mask files.

The version of MAD-X to be used for the conversion runs is defined in {\tt
sysenv} and defaults to the current production version.  At this point it is
also necessary to specify in \texttt{sixdeskenv}
\begin{description}
\item [pmass=938.272046] The mass of the proton \cite{NIST} which can be reset
  to 938.271998 for backwards compatibility with earlier studies.
\item [bunch\_charge=1.1500e+11] New bunch\_charge variable for
  fort.3.mother1\_[col/inj]
\item [runtype=] inj or coll for injection/collision for an LHC lattice.  For
  more information on how to define runtypes for either the LHC or other
  machines please see section \ref{sec:otherlattices}.
\item [beam=] null or b1 or B1 for Beam1, b2 or B2 for Beam2.
\item [CORR\_TEST=]0 or 1 if check\_mad6t is to copy the corrector strengths
for each seed into one file in sixtrack\_input.
\item [fort\_34=] If null the fort.34 files will not be copied to the {\tt
  sixtrack\_input} directory. These files define the multipole strengths for
  the linear lattice when doing Second Order Detuning and Distortion (SODD)
  analysis in expert mode.
\item [istamad=1] first seed for MAD-X.
\item [iendmad=] normally 60 (maximum 64) but it is recommended to use
  iendmad=1 until the results of the \texttt{run\_mad6t} are considered
  satisfactory.  The seeds are used to generate variations of the basic LHC
  machine with different randomly generated magnet errors.
\item[madclass=] \texttt{8nm} for 8 normalised CPU minutes, or \texttt{1nh} for 1
  normalised hour for the \texttt{run\_mad6t} LSF jobs where 8nm is often enough
  but \texttt{1nh} may be necessary.
\end{description}
After a \texttt{set\_env}, a \texttt{run\_mad6t} or \texttt{run\_mad6t -i} may be
performed.  The \texttt{-i} option means run interactively and get the output to
the screen or redirected to a file and can be useful for testing the mask file
and mad6t run.  The \texttt{platform} option is ignored as mad6t runs are either
performed on the desktop or on LSF. For reasons of numerical compatibility all
the \texttt{run\_mad6t} runs should be performed on the same type of machine.
Subsequently, LSF jobs may be used by {run\_mad6t}, one per seed, and they will
run in parallel.  In the case of multiple studies in a workspace, either a {\tt
set\_env "study"} can be performed or the study can be specified on the command
as \texttt{run\_mad6t} ``study''.
In all cases, the success/failure/correctness of these runs should be verified.
The script \texttt{check\_mad6t} checks what it can but it is essential to have a
look at the MAD-X output. This output can be found in the most recent {\tt
sixtrack\_input/mad.run\_mad6t*} directory.  Once the MAD-X run has completed
successfully for one seed, \texttt{iendmad} can be set to the desired value
(typically 60/64) and a new \texttt{run\_mad6t} command performed. Every {\tt
run\_six}, see later, starts with an internal \texttt{check\_mad6t}. To facilitate
checking the mad6t1.lsf and mad6t.lsf scripts now do some additional checking.
Two files ERRORS and WARNINGS may be produced and can be found in sixtrack\_input.
Ideally, after initial tests, the contents of sixtrack\_input should be deleted
and one \texttt{run\_mad6t} should be done for all seeds to ensure consistency. 
\texttt{run\_six} will not run if the ERRORS file exists.

\section{Problems, cleaning up, and support}

There are often problems at this initial stage: at any time the command {\tt
rm -r work/* track/* sixtrack\_input/*} will completely clean up and allow a
restart from the beginning. Help and diagnostics and error messages will be
found in the \texttt{sixdesk.log} file, one per study \footnotemark.
\footnotetext {Help with these procedures is always available from
Eric.McIntosh@cern.ch, by telephone, or by SKYPE to mcintosh94.  Accelerator
Physics issues should be initially addressed to Massimo.Giovannozzi@cern.ch or
Riccardo.de.Maria@cern.ch.}

\section{run\_six - Launching SixTrack Runs}
%
\label{sec:run_six}
It is usual to commence a study with some short runs or a few long runs using
LSF, perhaps with just a few seeds.

The script \texttt{run\_six} is used after setting the various variables as
explained below.  It will automatically launch tracking jobs into the LSF
batch system using the batch scripts in the directory \texttt{utilities} or
into the BOINC job submission buffer.  It is recommended to use LSF batch for
short runs and for exploratory studies, or when the binary files are required
for detailed examination.  BOINC is recommended for production runs and for
large studies of more than a few thousand jobs. Note that BOINC does not
produce the fort.20 graphics nor return any binary files. Only the
\texttt{fort.10.gz}  result file is returned which is enough for the
subsequent post-processing.  In addition note that the platforms LSF and BOINC
should not both be used in a single study; rather, once the preliminary
investigations are complete using LSF, a new study can be cloned to run full
scale production with BOINC using the same {\tt sixtrack\_input files} thus
avoiding another redundant \texttt{run\_mad6t}.  The experienced user is free
to modify the script as explained later.  The following variables, all
exported, as specified in the \texttt{sixdeskenv} file are used by this and
subsequent scripts.

\begin{description}
\item [tunex \& tuney] The required horizontal and vertical tunes.
These may be different for collision and injection as shown later.
\item [emit] The normalised LHC emittance.
\item [e0] Energy of reference particle depending on runtype
\item [dpini \& dpmax]
  At injection the initial relative momentum deviation is set to
  `dpini=0.00075' and at top energy it is set to `dpini=0.00027'.
  For the determination of the (non-linear) chromaticity a wider range is used:
  `dpmax=0.002' (see below).
\item [kstep]
  Used to define the step width of the phase space angle. For further
  information see section \ref{sec:run_six:shortrun}. The phase space angle is
  related to the emittance ratio via
  $\phi=\arctan\left(\sqrt{{\epsilon_y}/{\epsilon_x}}\right)$, where the
  emittance is defined as $\epsilon_z=A_z^2/\beta_z$, for $z=x,y$.
\item [dimen]
  The dimensionality of phase space can be chosen between 4 and 6. In the
  latter case the full six--dimensional tracking is done including cavities.
\item [chrom]
  To correct for slight differences between MAD and SixTrack the chromaticity
  is routinely corrected by setting `chrom' to 1 and using
\item[chrom\_eps=0.0000001] This operation will not be performed for `chrom=0'
  but \texttt{chromx chromy} will be used instead.
\item[chromx=2.] and
\item[chromy=2.] being the values used when `chrom=0'.
\item [sussix]
  To determine precise values for the detuning calculation this switch should
  be set to: `sussix=1'. It uses the sussix program~\cite{lines3}. This option
  is only valid for the short run configuration (see section
  \ref{sec:run_six:shortrun}).  (Problems have been found when using {\tt
  sussix} in the 6D case.)
\end{description}

\texttt{run\_six} can handle three different modes of tracking: Normally initial
investigations are carried out with \texttt{short} runs (and possibly {\tt
sussix}).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Short run ---
  This run mode is used to find chromaticity and detuning as a function of
  $\delta$ and amplitude respectively. Typically this is done with just 1,000
  turns (activate with \texttt{short=1} in \texttt{sixdeskenv}).  The other variables
  in \texttt{sixdeskenv} for this run are described in section
  \ref{sec:run_six:shortrun}.
\item Long run ---
  This mode is meant for the dynamic aperture determination proper (activate
  with \texttt{long=1} in \texttt{sixdeskenv}).  The other variables for this run are
  described in section \ref{sec:run_six:longrun}.
\item Differential Algebra (DA) run --- If high order Taylor maps are needed
  this is the mode to use (activate with \texttt{da=1}). This mode is mostly for
  expert use.  The \texttt{SixTrack} author F. Schmidt should be consulted on how
  to make best use of it.  In this case \texttt{run\_six} calls the porgrams
  readda, dalie4 and dalie6 in the directory \texttt{bin}.
\end{enumerate}

Note that only one type of run may be chosen at any one time; one and only one
of the \texttt{sixdeskenv} variables \texttt{short, long, da} may be set to 1.

The short/long runs both use seeds as specified by
\begin{description}
\item[ista=\$istamad] Start seed
\item[iend=\$iendmad] End seed
\end{description}
As shown above, the default seed range \texttt{ista, iend} for \texttt{run\_six} is
the same as that used for \texttt{run\_mad6t}, namely \texttt{istamad, iendmad}.
These values may be changed at any time, for example to submit jobs for a
limited range of seeds, but must clearly be a subset of the {run\_mad6t}
values.

\subsection{Short Run}
\label{sec:run_six:shortrun}

\begin{description}
\item[ns1s \& ns2s]
  Lower and upper amplitude range in beam $\sigma$.
\item[nss]
  Amplitude step in beam $\sigma$.
\item[turnss]
  Number of turns which is usually set to 1,000 in this mode.
\item[turnsse]
  This variable should be set to the number of zeros of `turnss',
  i.e. `3' in our example, it becomes part of the data directory
  structure. Therefore, if one decides to redo this analysis at say
  10,000 turns one specifies `turnsse=4' and subsequently the data
  are stored separate from those produced with `turnsse=3'.
\item[writebins]
  This defines after how many turns data are written to output
  files. In this mode it should always be set to: `writebins=1'
  since all turns are needed to find the tunes as a function of
  amplitude.
\item[kini \& kend]
  Initial and end angle in phase space. Typically set from `1' to
  `kmax=5' (see next variable). By specifying `kini=0' the nonlinear
  chromaticity is calculated as well (which uses the `dpmax' setting) and thereafter the initial
  angle is set back to: `kini=1'. Note that the variation from
  `kini' to `kend' is done in steps defined by `kstep'.
\item[kmax]
  This defines the number of phase space angles, e.g. `kmax=5'
  means that each step \texttt{kstep} is of: $90^\circ/(kmax+1)=15^\circ$.
\item[reson=0] switch for Guignard resonance calculation
\end{description}

\subsection{Long Run}
\label{sec:run_six:longrun}
\begin{description}
\item [ns1l \& ns2l]
  Lower and upper amplitude range in beam $\sigma$. This range is
  sub--divided into ranges of \texttt{nsincl} $\sigma$. In each job 30 pairs of
  particles are evenly distributed in each subrange. The
  close--by pairs are used to find the onset of chaos. Typically we
  find that a variation 2 $\sigma$ is sufficiently dense to find the
  minimum dynamic aperture with a precision of 0.5 $\sigma$.
\item [nsincl] 2 $\sigma$ is standard. A smaller step, of 0.5 say, 
can give better results.
\item [turnsl]
  For the long term tracking we usually track for 100,000 turns or for
one miliion.
\item [turnsle]
  This variable should be set to the number of zeros of `turnsl',
  i.e. `5' in our example. 
\item [writebinl]
  This defines after how many turns data are written to output
  files.

  \emph{Important}: make sure that \texttt{writebinl} is large enough
  otherwise huge amounts of data will be created. Occasionally that
  may be of use, however in most cases make sure that no more than a total of
  1,000 turns are recorded. This implies that for
  \texttt{turnsl=100000} the variable should be set to at least {\tt
  writebinl=100'}.  When running on BOINC, rather than LSF, the binary files
  are not returned but SixTrack is checkpointed every \texttt{writebinl} turns.
  It is recommended to set \texttt{writebinl} to 10000 for BOINC runs of 100,000
  turns or more.
\item[kinil \& kendl]
  Initial and end angle in phase space. As in the `short run' mode
  the variation from `kinil' to `kendl' is done in steps defined by
  `kstep'. 
\item [kmaxl]
  This defines the number of phase space angles, e.g. `kmaxl=5'
  means that each steps amounts to: $90^\circ/(kmaxl+1)=15^\circ$.
  Thus the actual angles are computed by dividing 90
  by kmaxl+1, so 5, 19, 59 for example are reasonable choices.
  The choice of \texttt{kmaxl} is discussed in Ref.~\cite{fandmpaper}.
\end{description}

Now the other physics and system parameters must be defined in the {\tt
sixdeskenv} file if the defaults are not suitable.  When the platform is
defined as LSF, LSF job class definitions will be required:
\begin{description}
\item[platform=LSF] or may be set to BOINC.
\item[longlsfq=1nd] sufficient for 100,000 turns, 60 particles
\item[classs=sixmedium] for short runs.
\item[classda=sixda] for the sixda jobs requiring large memory
\item[sixdeskforce=0] Should normally be left at 0 but may be set to 1 or 2 (see later)
\end{description}
The LSF job class defaults are normally satisfactory, but \texttt{longlsfq}
should be set to \texttt{2nd} or to \texttt{1nw} if performing more than $10^5$ turns.

\begin{description}
\item[ibtype=0] or 1 to use the Erskine/McIntosh optimised error function
of a complex number
\item[idfor=1] the closed orbit is added, if set to 0 the initial co-ordinates are unchanged
\item[sixdeskpairs=30] Normal value for 60 particles, naximum of 32. 
\end{description}

Then we have, depending on the \texttt{runtyp}:
\begin{verbatim}
if test $runtype = "inj"
then
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[e0=450000.] (energy)
\item[gamma=479.6] (gamma)
\item[dpini=0.00075] (initial relative momentum deviation)
\end{description}
\begin{verbatim}
elif test $runtype = "col"
then
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[e0=7000000.]
\item[gamma=7460.5]
\item[dpini=0.00027]
\end{description}
\begin{verbatim}
fi
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[dpmax=0.002] maximum momentum deviation for a short term run
\end{description}

Next we have the tunes again depending on the runtype:
\begin{description} 
\item[tune=0]
\end{description} 
In this case the \texttt{run\_six} will make a special local LSF run to compute
the tunes. Alternatively the tunes may be specified and in particular a
tunescan can be performed where the tunes will be computed on a straight line
from (tunex,tuney) with gradient deltay/deltax up to and including
(tunex1,tuney1).  The tunes must be 10 .le. tune .lt. 100 in format
dd.dd[d][d].  The folowing example specifies the tunes (64.28,59.31) with no
scan (because \texttt{tunex = tunex1, tuney = tuney1}. 
\begin{verbatim}
if test $runtype = "inj"
then
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[tunex=64.28] Start value
\item[tuney=59.31] Start value
\item[deltax=0.001] Increment to tunex
\item[deltay=0.001] Increment to tuney
\item[tunex1=64.28] End value
\item[tuney1=59.31] End value
\end{description}
\begin{verbatim}
elif test $runtype = "col"
then
\end{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[tunex=64.31]
\item[tuney=59.32]
\item[deltax=0.001]
\item[deltay=0.001]
\item[tunex1=64.31]
\item[tuney1=59.32]
\end{description}
\begin{verbatim}
fi
\end{verbatim}
The total number of jobs/cases can be computed as the product of the number of
seeds, the number of tune pairs, the number of amplitude intervals and the
number of angles.  The total number of cases and progress is reported in the
work directory and can be examined with the \texttt{run\_query} or {\tt
run\_status} commands.

Each batch job returns a result file \texttt{fort.10.gz} to the \texttt{track}
tree/hierarchy. For LSF studies, if the CASTOR switch is on in the \texttt{sysenv}
file, all the result files, including the binary files and the \texttt{fort.6}
output, are compressed in a tar file and written to \texttt{
\$CASTOR\_HOME/direct\_track/*} where the \texttt{direct\_track} tree matches the
\texttt{track} tree in AFS.

It is not recommended to run a study of more than 30,000 jobs/cases in a
single workspace but up to 100,000 still works. A study can be split over two
or more workspaces, perhaps by seed number, and the results combined.

Problems may, indeed often, arise when it is necessary to run the script more
than once, either because of a system crash, batch daemon not responding, jobs
lost, or some other error.  The script \texttt{run\_six} can be rerun as often as
necessary, but by default will not re-submit jobs. The \texttt{run\_six} can
either be submitted as a batch job and/or with a different seed range ({\tt
ista, iend}).  The \texttt{run\_six} script also keeps a copy of each LSF job in
the \texttt{track} hierarchy along with the data files or links {\tt fort.2.gz
fort.3.gz fort.8.gz fort.16.gz}.  It also updates the \texttt{taskids} file in
the \texttt{sixjobs/work} directory.  The \texttt{taskids} file contains one
line for each case. Each line contains the JobName (which can be mapped to the
case directory) and the associated LSF job\_ID(s) or BOINC ID(s).  If
\texttt{run\_six} is called more than once, it ignores cases where a non-zero
fort.10.gz exists, but otherwise deletes the tracking input files and
re-generates them. Even simpler recovery is available with the
\texttt{run\_missing\_jobs} command.  \emph{It is essential to wait for
  existing LSF jobs to complete, or to cancel
them, and do at least two \texttt{run\_status} commands before invoking \texttt{
run\_missing\_jobs}}. This procedure has proven to be extremely effective.  In
the worst of all cases wait for, or cancel, outstanding batch jobs with the
\texttt{bkill 0} command, and delete everything except the \texttt{sixtrack\_input}
with a \texttt{rm track/* work/*} command and restart.  

With BOINC the situation is simpler; near the end of a study a
\texttt{run\_incomplete\_cases} command will re-submit jobs for those cases where no
results are available. The script \texttt{run\_incomplete\_cases\_lsf} can also be
used to submit LSF jobs instead to get rid of the annoying tail of
unfinished Work Units.

\section{Monitoring the progress of the study.} \label{sec:status} The script
\texttt{run\_status} looks into the database \texttt{work} directory and updates and
summarises the status of the study. The \texttt{run\_query} command gives a quick
look without any updating. It first counts the number of cases in {\tt
work/taskids}.  It reports the number of LSF batch jobs generated, possibly
more than one per case, and does an LSF \texttt{bjobs} to report on job status.
Finally it performs a rather time-consuming search to find the number of
unfinished cases.  It also produces the files \texttt{completed\_jobs}, {\tt
incomplete\_jobs} and possibly \texttt{missing\_jobs} in the \texttt{\$sixdeskwork}
directory.  When all cases are complete the {run\_join10} procedure can be
initiated. While the \texttt{run\_status} command may take some time, many minutes
for 50,000 cases, it makes it very easy indeed to recover from LSF failures.
For example, in a recent study with 43,100 jobs over 800 jobs failed. One {\tt
run\_missing\_jobs} command re-submitted them automatically to successfully
complete the tracking.  As an alternative, the \texttt{run\_six} command can be
re-issued and will not re-submit jobs if \texttt{sixdeskforce = 0}. It will not
re-submit jobs which have been completed successfully if \texttt{sixdeskforce = 1}
AND a \texttt{fort.10.gz} result file has been created.

There are also cases of database corruption. These are cleaned up, after all
running LSF jobs have terminated, by the \texttt{correct\_cases} command. Overall
the environment has been proven to be rather robust and almost all errors can
be recovered as long as there is a valid \texttt{work/taskids} file.

\section{The \texttt{fort.10} file}
\label{sec:fort10}
The structure of the \texttt{fort.10} files is shown in Tables \ref{T-PPD} and
\ref{T-PPD2}, which have been taken from the official SixTrack manual
\cite{SixTrack} and updated with recent additions.  All values are
double-precision numbers, values encoded if necessary.  There is one (very
long) line per particle.

\section{The Other SixTrack Output Files and What the Run Environment
  Does With Them.}
\label{sec:otherfiles}

By default the scripts automatically tar all output files and store them
directly to CASTOR.  In order to view these files they have to be copied from
CASTOR using the standard CASTOR tools like \texttt{rfcp}, \texttt{rfrm} and {\tt
nsls, nsrm, nsmkdir} etc. The option \texttt{--help} is available for each of
these commands.

Although the full description of all output files is beyond the scope of this
note; an ascii file worth looking at is the \texttt{fort.6.gz} which gives an
explicit description of all operations and possible failures of the SixTrack
run as seen by the program. Also one finds the tracking data in the binary
files \texttt{fort.90.gz fort.89.gz etc} down to \texttt{fort.59.gz} in the cases of
64 particles/32 pairs, which may be useful for further analysis. These and
other files are all described in the SixTrack manual \cite{SixTrack}. Note that
these files are not available from BOINC runs which are for full scale
production; LSF should be used for testing and debugging. 

\section{Post-processing with run\_join10}
\texttt{run\_join10} gathers the results of completed jobs and produces combined
output files at level 4 in the \texttt{track} tree.  It also deletes any results
of previous \texttt{run\_join10} commands.  The result directory is named {\tt
\$ns1l-\$ns2l} e.g. 14-20 as compared to the
other amplitude directories e.g. 14\_16, 16\_18, etc.
There is one additional parameter for run\_join10 namely \texttt{turnsemax} which
is set automatically by \texttt{sixdeskenv} to \$turnsle or \$turnsse for
long/short studies. Missing files are reported to \texttt{sixdesk.log} but even
incomplete results may be useful. This procedure makes use of the utility
program \texttt{joinf10} in the directory \texttt{bin}.

\section{Post-processing with run\_post}
%
\label{sec:run_post}
After possibly joining the \texttt{fort.10} files they can be postprocessed to
find chaotic boundaries and particle losses by using the script {\tt
run\_post}, which in turn uses the program \texttt{read10b} in the directory {\tt
bin}.

There are a couple of options for plotting.  The  \texttt{sixdeskenv} variables
\texttt{iplot} and \texttt{kvar} specific to \texttt{run\_post} are used.  If {\tt
iplot=1} a plot is produced for each seed and the results can be found in the
\texttt{plot} directory. Note that setting \texttt{iplot} to 1 will produce a
possibly huge amount of data, even if it is compressed with gzip.  The variable
\texttt{kvar} should be set to 1 (the default) to obtain the DA as a function of
angles for a \texttt{long} study, and the DA over ALL seeds and angles is plotted
for each angle even if \texttt{iplot=0}. Note that this is an extremely time
consuming procedure. (For special post-processing of the \texttt{fort.10.gz} files
the set of \texttt{fort.15} files are produced and saved when \texttt{iplot = 1})

The following variables are used, almost certainly with the same values
as used by \texttt{run\_six} and \texttt{run\_join10}:
\begin{description}
\item [kinil \& kendl]
  Initial and end angle in phase space. The variation from `kinil' to
  `kendl' is done in steps defined by `kstep' (see below).
\item [kmaxl]
  This defines the number of phase space angles, e.g. `kmaxl=5'
  means that each step is of: $90^\circ/(kmaxl+1)=15^\circ$.
\item [kstep]
  Used to define the step width of the phase space angle.
\item [Ampl]
  The amplitude range in sigma. To distinguish the original amplitudes
  ranges from the joined ranges
  a hyphen is used `--' instead of an underscore `\_'. \texttt{Ampl}
is set automatically using \texttt{ns1s/ns2s} or \texttt{ns1l/ns2l}.
\item[turnse]
  This variable should be set to the number of zeros of number of
  turns processed,
  i.e. `5' in our example, it is part of the data directory
  structure. 
\item [short]
  In the example `short=0' means that the mode short run is not
  activated.
\item [long]
  In the example `long=1' means that the mode long run is activated.
\item [iplot]
  No plotting for each seed if `iplot=0'. If this flag is set to `1' or '2' the
  following graphics are produced:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Short run
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Chromaticity, i.e. the tune versus $\delta$.
    \item Horizontal and vertical detuning each in one plot for all
      tracked phase space angles.
    \item Tune foot print, i.e. vertical tune versus horizontal tune
      with the amplitude as a parameter.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Long run
    \begin{itemize}
    \item End value of the distance in phase space `d(turns)' of 2
      initially close--by particles as a function of initial
      amplitude.
    \item Fitted slope of $\log{d(turns)}$ versus $\log{(turns)}$ of
      the distance in phase space of 2 initially close--by particles
      as a function of initial amplitude. For details of the meaning
      of these two chaotic definitions please refer to
      reference~\cite{LHC8}.
    \item Survival plot, i.e. survival time versus initial amplitude.
    \item Horizontal and vertical smear as a function of initial
      amplitude.
    \item Phase space averaged amplitude versus initial amplitude.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  For `iplot=2' these plots are automatically printed using
  your normal Linux \$PRINT\_CMD.
  Obviously, great care has to be taken to avoid a
  swamping the printer. The graphics are stored as files
  like \texttt{test.ps.gz} in the directory  
  \texttt{sixjobs/plot/"study"} with the same tree structure as the
  \texttt{track} tree but with a hidden \texttt{.angle} directory.
\end{description}

The \texttt{DA*} result files, one per angle, from \texttt{run\_post} in long mode
are called \texttt{DAres."Study"."Tunes."Turns exponent"."Angle"}, and are stored
in the \texttt{sixjobs} directory itself.  The contents and format are defined in
the next section \ref{sec:DAres} It should be noted again that setting {\tt
kvar=1} causes \texttt{run\_post} to take a long time, even a very long time of
many hours, for a large number of angles. If both \texttt{iplot} and \texttt{kvar}
are set to 0 the \texttt{DAres.Study.Tunes.Turns exponent.Angle} files are
produced anyway and can be processed with \texttt{run\_awk} or your own
procedures. A partial view of the \texttt{sixjobs/plot} directory is shown in
Appendix C.

\section{The DAres files}
\label{sec:DAres}
These files contain the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run name for particular seed.
\item ``Strict'' chaotic boundary via slope method~\cite{LHC8}.
\item ``Certain'' chaotic boundary via large distance in phase space
  method~\cite{LHC8}.
\item Dynamic aperture concerning the phase space averaged amplitude
  (preferred value).
\item Raw dynamic aperture concerning initial amplitude (to be used
  with care).
\item Lower bound of tracked amplitude range.
\item Upper bound of tracked amplitude range.
\end{itemize}

%/afs/cern.ch/project/lhcnap/projects/sixtrack/.@sys/six/extra/read10b.f,
%which Eric reported to be the source of read10b used in run_post, there
%are still questions on the physics reasons behind the code, although the
%general algorithm looks more clear, but still not fully specified.

%What follows is my interpretation with the current open questions.

The algorithm producing the values can be described in the following steps.
The code (\texttt{read10b}) first reads the joined \texttt{fort}.10.  If the
emittance of the mode I (\texttt{emitI}) is smaller than \texttt{1E-10} then the
initial coordinate $x$ is replaced by \texttt{sqrt(betx*emitI)}. The same for
$y$.

%(1) Is emitI twice the action in mm**2?
%(2) Why 1e-10 has been used as a threshold?
%   a) because the determination of the emitI is unreliable for small
%   numbers
%   b) because the emitI is unreliable for small number

The first amplitude of the \texttt{fort.10} is analyzed in order to obtain:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{rat}: the tangent of the \texttt{emitII/emitI};
\item \texttt{rad}: ratio between \texttt{emitI/emit} (
or \texttt{emitII/emit} if \texttt{rat>1}) if \\ {\tt emit=
emitI**2+emitII**2} normalized with the real emittance of the beam specified
by the user.  If \texttt{emitI} is small then \texttt{emitI} is estimated using the
initial conditions;
\item \texttt{rad1}: same quantity as \texttt{rad} but evaluated as before using the
average amplitudes if \texttt{emitI} is small otherwise using the average
amplitudes and the secondary beta functions;
\end{itemize}

\texttt{rat}, \texttt{rad}, and \texttt{rad1} will be used for all the other amplitudes
in the following analysis.

%(3) why the first amplitude is used and not the one turn map to
%translate amplitude in real space to amplitudes in sigma for DA?
%(4) same as 2 here
%(5) how the amplitude average is computed?
%  a) first 1000 turns
%  b) first max number of turns / 100
%  c) last turns 1000 before loss

The analysis of all the amplitudes starts with:
\begin{itemize}
\item the chaotic boundary with slope method, \texttt{achaos},
\item distance in the phase space with slope method, \texttt{achaos1}
\item initial condition of lost particle, \texttt{alost2}
\item average initial condition, average corrected, of a lost particle,
  \texttt{alost1}
\end{itemize}

\texttt{achaos} is set to the first amplitude (normalized with \texttt{rad}) until
an amplitude is found chaotic. It means that if the first amplitude is chaotic
or all amplitudes are chaotic the result does not change.
%(6) why the threshold is chosen to be 2, 1/2 and not stricter?
\texttt{achaos1} is zero until an amplitude is found chaotic.
%(7) in which unit the distance in the phase space is expressed?
%(8) why the threshold for distance is set to 0.01
\texttt{alost2} is the amplitude normalized with \texttt{rad} of the first lost
amplitude.

For the amplitudes between the \texttt{achaos} and \texttt{achaos1}, the average
ratio between \texttt{rad*x} and \texttt{rad1*x\_average} is computed. If the ratio
is in between 0.9 and 1.1 than \texttt{alost2} is corrected by this average ratio
and stored in \texttt{alost1}. If outside of the bounds \texttt{alost1} is inverted.
If there is no amplitudes in between \texttt{achaos} and \texttt{achaos1}, {\tt
alost1==alost2}.

%(9) is this correction robust and justified? The da normalization of one
%amplitudes depends strongly on the one of the first amplitude and weakly
%on the motion of all the others.

The code ends reporting \texttt{achaos}, \texttt{achaos2}, \texttt{alost1}, {\tt
alost2}, \texttt{rad} normalized first amplitude and last amplitude.

\texttt{run\_awk} uses the DAres* files from \texttt{run\_post}, reports to the
screen, and produces a simple plot file named DAres*.plot.

\section{Running studies in batch and/or parallel}
In summary a study can be run in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item [] Create a study by \texttt{set\_env} and after creating the
\texttt{mask} file in the \texttt{mask} directory do a \texttt{run\_mad6t}.
Repeat as often as necessary until \texttt{check\_mad6t} is successful
and the \texttt{mad6t} output has been verified.
\item [] For a large study use \texttt{run\_six} in a batch job by
for example:
\begin{verbatim}
  bsub -q1nd 'cd w1/sixjobs;run_six job_tracking LSF'
\end{verbatim}
to submit all cases of the study \texttt{job\_tracking} in workspace \texttt{w1} using LSF.
The progress of the command can be monitored by \texttt{tail -f sixdesk.log} or
\texttt{bpeek "LSFJobID"}.
\item Use \texttt{run\_status} or \texttt{run\_status job\_tracking}, as frequently 
as convenient until all cases are complete or all batch jobs have terminated.
The command \texttt{correct\_cases} can be used if the database appears to be
inconsistent (but only after all LSF jobs have terminated). It checks each case
and updates the complete/incomplete status.  If there are incomplete cases with
LSF do a \texttt{run\_missing\_jobs}. With BOINC use a run\_incomplete\_cases to
speed up the completion of the study or to handle the tail of incomplete cases.
When all cases have been completed do a
\item \texttt{run\_join10} or {\tt bsub -q1nd 'cd w1/sixjobs;run\_join10
  job\_tracking'} followed by a
\item \texttt{run\_post} or \texttt{bsub -q1nd 'cd w1/sixjobs;run\_post job\_tracking'}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lockfiles} It is necessary to use locks in order to avoid conflicting
modifications to a file. A directory is locked if it contains a file
sixdesklock in read only mode (444).  If a script fails or dies for some reason
or a batch job is killed this lock file may be left behind. The script {\tt
check\_locks} reports lock status for the current study; {\tt
check\_all\_locks} for the workspace. If the study itself is locked, it will be
reported first as such a lock inhibits further checking.  {\tt unlock
"directory"} frees the lock. The \texttt{unlock\_all} unlocks all locks, but is
deprecated when there is more than one active study in the workspace. If in
doubt about a lock, and the information shown by the check commands, simply do
a \texttt{check\_lock "directory"} or \texttt{cat sixdesklock} and {\tt ls -l
sixdesklock} in the relevant directory, to see which script, process and
machine are holding the lock and since when. The general philosophy is to lock
the study so that only one operation at a time is permitted. Most command wait
for the study to be unlocked but the \texttt{run\_results} command for BOINC just
exits on the grounds that it will be run periodically, nornally as an {\tt
acrontab} entry.

\section{BOINC}
The sixdesk environment was designed to make it as transparent as possible to
use LSF or the 
Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing BOINC \cite{Boinc}.
which has made over 100,000 PCs available for tracking studies.
There is one additional step required, namely \texttt{run\_results}, to
retrieve result files from the BOINC Web server 
and move the \texttt{fort.10.gz} to the appropriate directory.
Only this file is returned, no \texttt{fort.6} or binary
or graphics files and nothing is written to CASTOR.
To use BOINC the \texttt{sixdeskenv} file is modified to

\begin{description}
\item[platform=BOINC]
\end{description}
and that is all.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{run\_mad6t} operates identically as for LSF.
\item \texttt{check\_mad6t} as for LSF.
\item \texttt{run\_six} as for LSF. 
\item \texttt{run\_status} as for LSF. 
\item \texttt{run\_results} must now be called to get the fort.10.gz file from the
BOINC server. It can be called regularly, automatically, by using an acrontab
entry in AFS, and there is an example \texttt{acrontab.entry} in the \texttt{sixjobs}
directory. In addition a \texttt{run\_incomplete\_cases} script has been
implemented to allow the use of multiple tasks for a case. This is particularly
useful towards the end of a run, when say 90\% of the cases are complete, in
order to speed up completion of the study.

Unlike LSF which returns all result files directly to the \texttt{track} tree with
no checking and over-writing existing results, BOINC compares the results file
fort.10.gz with any existing result and reports any differences to {\tt
sixdesk.log}.
\item when all cases are complete the {run\_join10} and \texttt{run\_post}
  procedures are used as with LSF.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Modifying the scripts/commands}

All modifications should be made to the scripts in the directory \texttt{scripts}.
The source script beginning with the characters "my" should be modified when it
exists rather than the derived script e.g. modify \texttt{myrun\_six} and NOT
{run\_six}. The script \texttt{domyseds}, which operates on all the files/scripts
in the file \texttt{allscripts}, should then be executed to expand macros in
scripts named "my*" to produce the actual command scripts, and to copy  all the
commands to \texttt{../sixjobs}.

Here is a more or less alphabetic list of the "my" scripts:
\begin{itemize}
\item mybackup\_study to CASTOR
\item mybackup\_workspace to CASTOR
\item mycheck\_all\_locks Tries to check for any locks in the workspace
\item mycheck\_lock Checks a specified directory or \texttt{sixjobs}
\item mycheck\_locks Tries to check for any locks in the current study
\item mycheck\_mad6t Does minimal checks on the \texttt{sixtrack\_input}
\item mycorrect\_cases Re-generates {completed\_cases} and \texttt{incomplete\_cases}
using the \texttt{taskids} file and checking for the presence of \texttt{fort.10.gz}
\item mydelete\_study deletes all or parts of a study based on replies
to prompts
\item mydorun\_mad6t called by run\_mad6t
\item myget\_all\_betavalues Writes all betavalues to STDOUT
\item mymywhich Writes some important variables to STDOUT
\item myrecall\_study from CASTOR
\item myrecall\_workspace from CASTOR
\item myrerun\_all\_cases (Used to rerun\_all cases on BOINC)
\item myrun\_awk Processes all the DAres* files and writes a summary to STDOUT
\item myrun\_incomplete\_cases Re-submits incomplete cases to BOINC
\item myrun\_incomplete\_tasks (Rarely used)
\item myrun\_join10 Joins all \texttt{fort.10.gz} files in preparation for \texttt{run\_post}
\item myrun\_missing\_jobs Re-submits any LSF jobs which have failed (after \texttt{run\_status}
\item myrun\_post Does the post-processing to produce graphics and the DAres* files
\item myrun\_query A quick and brief status report
\item myrun\_results Retrieves BOINC results
\item myrun\_six Submits all LSF jobs or BOINC Work Units (after {run\_mad6t}
\item myrun\_status Reports status and updates the database for the platform LSF
\item myset\_env Used to save the environment after changes to \texttt{sixdeskenv sysenv}, 
ito create a study, or to switch studies
\item myunlock Unlocks the specified directory or \texttt{sixjobs}
\item myunlock\_all An unlock of all locks of the current study and any other
workspace locks not specific to a study \texttt{sixjobs}, \texttt{plot} and \texttt{sixdeskTaskIds}
\end{itemize}
and here is a list of some other useful scripts/commands without macros. 
\begin{itemize}
\item bresume\_all Resume all suspended batch jobs
\item bstop\_all Stop all batch jobs
\item get\_wpro A sample script for using from acron to get results
\item minav.awk The awk script used by run\_awk
\item print\_env Writes the \texttt{sixdeskenv sysenv} variables and values to STDOUT
\item query\_all Does a \texttt{run\_status} for each study in a workspace
\item sub\_wpro A sample script for doing a \texttt{run\_six} in batch LSF
\end{itemize}
\section{The Subroutines}
These subroutines are all defined in the file mydot\_profile and may therefore
use macros themselves. A \texttt{. ./dot\_profile} statement is issued when
starting a script in order to make them available.  They are called by the
corresponding "my" macros as shown.
\begin{itemize}
\item sixdeskmess() mymess \texttt{messagelevel} \texttt{text}
where the messagelevel is an integer 0, 1 or 2 and the text is 
a doublequoted string. It uses the \texttt{sixdeskenv} parameters 
\texttt{sixdeskecho} and \texttt{sixdesklevel}. 
If \texttt{sixdesklevel} =  0 then only basic and error messages are logged.
If \texttt{sixdesklevel} = 1 then additional information is logged and if
\texttt{sixdesklevel} = 2 then further debug ifnormation is also logged.
If \texttt{sixdeskecho}  = "" only minimum information is echoed to STDOUT
and otherwise all messages are also echoed.
\item sixdeskmktmp() mymktmp \texttt{name (dir)} makes a uniquely named temporary
  file in the specified directory \texttt{dir} or in \texttt{.} and returns the full
  pathname in \texttt{\$name} 
\item sixdeskmktmpdir() mymktmpdir \texttt{name (dir)} makes a uniquely named
  temporary directory in the specified directory \texttt{dir} or in \texttt{.} and
  returns the full pathname in \texttt{\$name}
\item sixdeskexit() myexit \texttt{integer} exits with the code \texttt{integer}
  freeing any locks
\item sixdeskunlock() myunlock \texttt{(dir)} unlocks the specified directory or
  \texttt{.}
\item sixdesklock() mylock \texttt{(dir)} Locks the specified directory {\tt
  (dir)} or \texttt{.}
\item sixdesktunes() mytunes Converts the tunes and deltas specified in {\tt
  sixdeskenv} to integers and logs the values in \texttt{sixdesk.log} 
\item sixdeskinttunes() myinttunes Uses the integer tunes to produce values to
  replace placeholders in fort.3
\item sixdeskamps() myamps Generates the equivalent integer values for
  amplitudes
\item sixdeskrundir() myrundir \texttt{name1 name2} Converts the specified run
  \texttt{name1} to the equivalent unique directory name which is returned in {\tt
  \$name2}
\end{itemize}
The scripts:
\begin{itemize}
\item [my]dot\_boinc
\item [my]dot\_bsub
\end{itemize}
are effectively subroutines used by run\_six.
The scripts
\begin{itemize}
\item [my]dot\_env
\item [my]dot\_profile
\end{itemize}
are called by almost every other script to establish the environment and make
the subroutines available.

\section{Backing up the workspace}
\label{sec:backup}
The AFS scratch disks at CERN are not (yet) backed up.  It is recommended that
you periodically run a backup so that data can be recovered easily in case of a
scratch disk failure. It is also recommended to a {\tt backup\_study
[job\_tracking]} when a study \texttt{job\_tracking} is complete.
The study may then be deleted safely.

These backups can be done rather simply in a batch job. First is shown an
example of backing up your scratch disks and then the rather more sophisticated
facilities available for SixDesk tracking studies and workspaces.

NOTA BENE: all \texttt{castor\_backups} save the logs in your \texttt{~/castor/logs}.
Although these are gzipped and might be useful if you forget the contents of a
backup you may also just want to delete them to save space in your HOME
directory.  The contents of backups can be always be determined from the
backups themselves. Note also that for all backups, links are NOT followed.
Further a link to a non-existent file is NOT backed up.

\subsection{Backing up scratch disks}
Everyone has a CASTOR account and a default \texttt{\$CASTOR\_HOME} directory {\tt
/castor/cern.ch/user/\$INITIAL/\$LOGNAME}. All the \texttt{ns} commands like {\tt
nsls, nsrm, nsmkdir} etc use this by default. In this example all the backups
are in the CASTOR directory \texttt{scratch\_backups}.  In the examples below {\tt
date} is of the form \texttt{yyyy-mm-dd} (and \texttt{mydate} is just {\tt
-yyyy-mm-dd}).  The batch job script, which must have execute permission, is as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
#!/bin/sh
# Do a dated (by day) backup of all scratch disks to 
#  $CASTOR_HOME/scratch_backups
# and log the reports in ~/backup_scratch.reports
#
cd $HOME
mydate="-`date -Idate`"
echo "" >> backup_scratch.reports
echo "Scratch backup reports$mydate" >> backup_scratch.reports
echo "Scratch backup reports$mydate"
echo "" >> backup_scratch.reports
for i in `ls -d scratch*`
do
  echo "Backing up $i to scratch_backups/$i$mydate" \
       >> backup_scratch.reports
  echo "Backing up $i to scratch_backups/$i$mydate"
  castor_backup $i scratch_backups/$i$mydate
  nsls -l scratch_backups/$i$mydate >> backup_scratch.reports
  nsls -l scratch_backups/$i$mydate
done
\end{verbatim}

If the job runs to completion (as can be checked in the LSF STDOUT or the
backup\_scratch\_reports) a lost disk, scratch0 say, can be restored with a
\begin{verbatim}
cd $HOME
castor_recall scratch_backups/scratch0"mydate"/scratch0
\end{verbatim}
where "mydate" identifies the backup to be used. \texttt{nsls scratch\_backups}
will show all available backups. Clearly this can also be done in a batch job.
To recall to a different place
\begin{verbatim}
cd $HOME/scratch99
castor_recall scratch_backups/scratch0"date"/scratch0 .
\end{verbatim}
will recall all the files to the directory \texttt{scratch99}.

\subsection{Backing up SixDesk workspaces and directories}
The intended usage is that in order to free up disk space a study can be backed
up and then deleted. It may later be recalled to exactly the same workspace or
to a new different workspace. The \texttt{backup\_workspace} command might be
used to backup a complete set of studies. A study may be recalled from either a
workspace backup or a study backup.

Deleted studies are never backed up; a non-deleted study cannot be recalled to
the same workspace unless it has first been deleted.  Deleting a study does NOT
delete the \texttt{sixjobs} directory and all \texttt{sixdeskenv} and \texttt{sysenv}
files are kept in the studies directory. All DAres* files
are also preserved.

All backup/recall commands should be issued from the \texttt{sixjobs} directory as
usual except for \texttt{recall\_workspace} which should be one level above e.g.
\texttt{w1}.

In these examples "date" is of the form ddmmyy.  So, normally, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~w1/sixjobs
  set_env job_tracking
  backup_study
  delete_study
\end{verbatim}
and subsequently
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~w1/sixjobs
  set_env job_tracking
  recall_study w1%job_tracking%"date"
\end{verbatim}
or to recall to a new different workspace
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~w1/sixjobs
  set_env job_tracking
  recall_study w1%job_tracking%"date" w99
\end{verbatim}

In the latter case the sixdeskenv files are edited to reflect the new
workspace. In all recalls, an existing sixjobs directory is never overwritten,
but in all cases the sixtrack\_input, track, work, and plot data are recalled
along with logfiles if possible.  To recall several studies to a new workspace,
the first recall will recall sixjobs as well as the data; afterwards, \texttt{cd}
to the workspace to recall other studies.  As mentioned a study can be
similarly recalled from a workspace backup by
\begin{verbatim}
  set_env job_tracking
  recall_study w1%"date" to restore it to w1 
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  set_env job_tracking
  recall_study w1%"date" w99 to a new empty workspace.
\end{verbatim}
Finally a complete workspace can be recalled to the same workspace or a
different one.  To backup a workspace
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~/w1/sixjobs
  backup_workspace
\end{verbatim}
and to recall
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~/w1
  recall_workspace w1%"date"
\end{verbatim}
or, since a new different workspace is empty, we must first get a copy of the
\texttt{recall\_workspace} script
\begin{verbatim}
  cd ~/w99
  cp SOMEWHERE/recall_workspace .
  ./recall_workspace w1%"date"
\end{verbatim}

All backups can be found in \$CASTOR\_HOME/workspace\_backups with names like
\texttt{w1\%job\_tracking\%"date"} for a study backup or \texttt{w1\%"date"} for a
workspace backup.  The command \texttt{nsls workspace\_backups} will list all
available backups.

All backups are automatically restartable from checkpoints as they may take
some time and are subject to the usual system failures. A file {\tt
backup\_study.list} or \texttt{backup\_workspace.list} is used for restarting from
the point of failure. Thus a backup must be completed before a new backup is
started in the same workspace (or the \texttt{file backup\_study.list} or {\tt
backup\_workspace.list} must be deleted). The workspace is locked to ensure
only one backup at a time and no switching of studies.

These procedures may seem complicated but the simple backup, delete, recall are
easy to perform and the complications are necessary to avoid destroying data
and to recover from system failures. Details of the CASTOR backups/ recalls can
be found in the \texttt{castor\_backup.log} or {castor\_recall.log} in the {\tt
sixjobs} directory.

\section{Other lattices}
\label{sec:otherlattices}

Clearly any lattice file may be processed by the run environment not just the
LHC. The mask file has to be changed as appropriate.  Other changes are
described in the main part of this note, including aesthetic name changes. Also
required are definitions of the \texttt{runtype} (see section \ref{sec:mad_6t}).
This variable and the variable \texttt{beam} specify which of the {\tt
fort.3.mother1} and \texttt{fort.3.mother2} files from the directory {\tt
sixjobs/control\_files} to use. The value of the \texttt{runtype and beam}
variables simply specify the suffix of the files to be used from this
directory. For how these files are constructed the user is refered to the
SixTrack manual \cite{SixTrack}.
