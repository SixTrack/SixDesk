# few dirty notes, while waiting for a more suitable documentation

* choice of platform:
  HTCondor is convenient in case of creation of simulation set-up (eg finalise
  configuration to scan):
  - short/few jobs;
  - creating simulation set up, for which fast responsiveness of simulations
    is key to quickly advance;
  - re-submit missing jobs from BOINC;
  BOINC is convenient in case of (eg produce results):
  - long/many jobs;
  - fast responsiveness (eg within 2h) of results is not key to progress, but
    production is the action;

* retrieval of results:
  - based on last platform used:
    . run_results -> BOINC;
    . run_status -> HTCondor, HTBoinc;

* pre-requisites:
  - running on lxplus: none;
  - running on local local machine:
    @ kerberos: kinit/klist;
    @ AFS mounted:
      . for MADX optics files;
      . for submission to BOINC;
    @ HTCondor locally installed;
    @ python2.7:
      . default path used by SixDesk in lxplus:
        /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_88/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh
      . on a local machine which mounts AFS, usually the default path is found;
  
* workflow of production of results with BOINC (including "processed" folder);
