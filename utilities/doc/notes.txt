# few dirty notes, while waiting for a more suitable documentation

* choice of platform:
  HTCondor is convenient in case of creation of simulation set-up (eg finalise
  configuration to scan):
  - short/few jobs;
  - creating simulation set up, for which fast responsiveness of simulations
    is key to quickly advance;
  - re-submit missing jobs from BOINC;
  BOINC is convenient in case of (eg produce results):
  - long/many jobs;
  - fast responsiveness (eg within 2h) of results is not key to progress, but
    production is the action;
