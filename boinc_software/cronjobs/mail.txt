Dear SixDesk user <SixDeskUser>,

Please find in attachment a list of directories in the BOINC spooldir
   <spooldir>
older than <xxx> days which belong to you. These directories have been
used ONLY to submit work units to BOINC and retrieve results.

If you think that you will no longer need these directories, then I could
remove them, freeing disk space and improving the performance of the system.
To do so, after you had a look at the list, please upload it to
   <spooldir>/delete
and I will take care of cleaning.

If you think that, for any reason, some directories should not be removed,
then please remove them from the list, either heading a '#' char to the name
of the study or deleting the line.

Thanks for your cooperation,
Alessio (via a crontab job)

NB: checking of old studies is periodically performed every month.
Once you upload any list, it may take up to 24h before deleting actually
takes place.

NB: Please find below the breakdown of the space taken by your spooldirs:
