Dear SixDesk user <SixDeskUser>,

Please find in attachment a list of buffer directories in the BOINC spooldir
   <spooldir>
older than <xxx> days which belong to you. These directories have been
used ONLY as BOINC buffers, i.e. to submit work units to BOINC and retrieve
results.

If you think that you will no longer need these directories (e.g. because
the study is complete), then I could remove them, freeing disk space and
improving the performance of the system. To do so, after you had a look at
the list, please upload it to
   <spooldir>/delete
and I will take care of cleaning.

If you think that, for any reason, some directories should not be deleted
(e.g. because the study is still on-going and you are still waiting for
results), then please remove them from the list, either heading a '#' char
to the name of the study or deleting the corresponding line.

I remain at your disposal for any questions.

Thanks for your cooperation,
Alessio (via a crontab job)

NB: checking of old studies is periodically performed every month.
Once you upload the list, it may take up to 24h before deleting actually
takes place.

NB: please be reminded that the TOTAL disk space available on the AFS
volume work.boinc (where the BOINC spooldir is located) is 100GB.
This value is a total one; hence, the occupancy by all users is summed up.

NB: Please find below the breakdown of the space taken by your directories in
the quoted BOINC spooldir:
